description: Initialize opencode-sync configuration
---
Use the opencode_sync tool with command "init".
If the repo is unknown, ask for a GitHub repo (owner/name or URL).
If the user wants to create it, pass create=true and private=true unless they request public.
Include includeSecrets if the user explicitly opts in.
